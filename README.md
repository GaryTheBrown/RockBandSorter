USAGE:
python3 sorter.py [input folder] [output folder]

Files need to be split into Single DLC with the filenames as "Artist - Song" for this program to work
C3 CON Tools is the best tool for this just split all your packs and make sure they are named as above.

The program will move files about so make a backup.

All unknown Songs Will be left where they are. you will need to add them to the CSV and re run the Program to sort them. please push back the csv to me so we can keep a complete list of songs.

this is part of a Bigger Personal project for converting Rock Band Library To one of the many PC clones for preservation.

Song Protection will not be included inside of the bigger project I am working on which will do the conversion process from all DLC including Packs. (Please Note Packs of DLC will not work with this program. an update may contain This feature but I may leave it until the Bigger Rock Band to [PC CLONE] Project which will be released once I have it at a releasable Postion)
